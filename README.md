1. Binary Tree Traversal

Implementation of the functionalities of BinaryTree class to store the elements in a binary tree and return the data by traversing them using inorder, postorder and preorder. 

Bsic Info:
The inorder traversal follows the recursive visitation sequence: Left child, Root, Right child. 
The postorder traversal follows the recursive visitation sequence:  Left Child, Right child, Root 
The preorder traversal follows the recursive visitation sequence:  Root, Left child, Right child 

Test Case :
Input : Add elements {60, 55, 100, 57, 107,67,45}; binaryTree.getData("inorder")
Output : {45, 55, 57, 60, 67, 100, 107 } 

2. Fibonacci Prime Check

A Fibonacci prime is a Fibonacci number and it is prime number. Given a list of integer numbers you need to find if the given number is prime number as well as it occurs in the Fibonacci series.  
 
 Test Case:
 Input : 10, 3, 5, 4, 89 
 Output : ‘n’, ‘y’, ‘y’, ‘n’, ‘y’ 

3. Reverse Word in Sentence

Given a sentence which consists of alphabets [a-zA-Z], digits [0-9], “,” and “.”. 
Reversing has to be done word-by-word.  

Test Case:
Input : cup of hot coffee costs 8.00, whereas cold coffee costs 45.00.
Output : 1 puc fo toh eeffoc stsoc 8.00, saerehw dloc eeffoc stsoc 45.00.
